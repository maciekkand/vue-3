I. Code

1. httpsPattern = /^https:\/\/.+/ - seems to be overly general, as it only cares about 'htttps://' prefix, so I extended it

2. If urls would likely be also compared in some other part of the application, I would extract 'validateUrl' method
   and move it to utils/url.js file

3. If the above applies to input boxes, I would extract input box into separate subcomponent

4. type="text" - is a default setting, so it may be removed in this case

5. I modified error messages, to make them sound slightly softer

6. In general, tag <style> should be appended with 'scoped', so that local css does not leak to other components.
    However, for css variable to work here, besides adding 2 sass dependencies, removing 'scoped' was necessary.
    Sadly, there was no time for further investigation.

    Since adding external dependencies was not allowed ('Do not add any external dependencies..'),
    easy alternative is to replace css variable with plain color property, but I am taking my chance leaving it as it is :)

II. Architecture

1. I would consider upgrading vue to version 3.3, as it introduces several valuable improvements.
   Since current version is 3.2.45, upgrade does not seem to be overly difficult

2. Unless there are some specific reasons, the same for migrating webpack to vite, for its speed and simplicity

3. Similarly, since you seem to use Puppeteer (as per your job offer), I would consider Playwright,
   as it is more focused on e2e testing (and made by the same core team of people)

4. If this is an internet (rather than intranet) application, I would consider applying server-side rendering,
   to speed-up initial load and improve SEO. For that and much better dx, Nuxt3 seems to be the best solution

5. For any non-trivial and/or more than one form, I would consider using FormKit or vee-validate
   (preferably with shadcn-vue UI library)
